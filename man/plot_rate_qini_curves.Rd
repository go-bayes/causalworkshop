\title{Plot Rate and Qini Curves for Targeting Analysis}
\usage{
plot_rate_qini_curves(
  data,
  tau_var = "tau_hat",
  title = "Targeting Performance Analysis"
)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A data frame with predicted treatment effects (tau_hat column)}

\item{tau_var}{Character. Name of predicted treatment effect variable (default: "tau_hat")}

\item{title}{Character. Plot title (default: "Targeting Performance Analysis")}
}
\value{
A list containing rate_plot, qini_plot, and efficiency_plot
}
\description{
Creates visualizations of targeting performance using Rate and Qini curves
to evaluate the value of treatment effect heterogeneity for policy targeting.
}
\details{
Rate curves show the gain in average treatment effect achieved by targeting
individuals with the highest predicted effects, compared to random assignment.

Qini curves show the cumulative gain from targeting, measuring the total
additional benefit obtained by targeting vs random treatment assignment.

Both curves help evaluate whether treatment effect heterogeneity is sufficient
to warrant targeted interventions rather than universal treatment.
