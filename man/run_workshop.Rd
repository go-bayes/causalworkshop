\usage{
run_workshop(
  n = 1000,
  seed = 2025,
  include_plots = TRUE,
  include_targeting = TRUE,
  verbose = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{n}{Integer. Sample size for simulation (default: 1000)}

\item{seed}{Integer. Random seed for reproducibility (default: 2025)}

\item{include_plots}{Logical. Whether to generate plots (default: TRUE)}

\item{include_targeting}{Logical. Whether to include targeting analysis (default: TRUE)}

\item{verbose}{Logical. Whether to print detailed output (default: TRUE)}
}
\value{
A list containing results from all workshop modules:
\describe{
\item{data}{The simulated dataset used throughout}
\item{baseline_results}{Results from baseline adjustment analysis}
\item{causal_forest_results}{Results from causal forest analysis}
\item{targeting_plots}{Rate and Qini curve visualizations (if requested)}
\item{heterogeneity_plot}{Treatment effect distribution plot (if requested)}
\item{selection_bias_plot}{Selection bias demonstration plot (if requested)}
}
}
\description{
Executes the full workshop pipeline demonstrating causal inference concepts
from baseline adjustment through advanced targeting analysis.
}
\details{
This function provides a complete educational workflow covering:
\enumerate{
\item \strong{Data Simulation}: Realistic data with selection bias and heterogeneous effects
\item \strong{Baseline Adjustment}: Demonstrates importance of controlling for confounders
\item \strong{Causal Forests}: Estimates individual treatment effects Ï„(x)
\item \strong{Targeting Analysis}: Evaluates policy targeting using Rate and Qini curves
\item \strong{Visualization}: Creates publication-ready plots for all analyses
}

The workshop is designed to be run interactively, with detailed explanations
and interpretations provided throughout. Each module can also be run
independently using the individual workshop functions.
