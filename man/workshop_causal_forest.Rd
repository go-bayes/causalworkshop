\title{Workshop: Causal Forest Analysis for Heterogeneous Treatment Effects}
\usage{
workshop_causal_forest(
  data = NULL,
  outcome_var = "charity_outcome",
  treatment_var = "belief_god_binary",
  covariate_vars = c("age", "education", "income", "baseline_charity",
    "baseline_volunteer"),
  num_trees = 1000,
  verbose = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A data frame with treatment, outcome, and covariate variables.
If NULL, simulates data using \code{simulate_religious_data()}.}

\item{outcome_var}{Character. Name of outcome variable (default: "charity_outcome")}

\item{treatment_var}{Character. Name of treatment variable (default: "belief_god_binary")}

\item{covariate_vars}{Character vector. Names of covariate variables
(default: c("age", "education", "income", "baseline_charity", "baseline_volunteer"))}

\item{num_trees}{Integer. Number of trees in the forest (default: 1000)}

\item{verbose}{Logical. Whether to print detailed output (default: TRUE)}
}
\value{
A list containing:
\describe{
\item{causal_forest}{The fitted causal forest object}
\item{predictions}{Data with individual treatment effect predictions}
\item{heterogeneity_stats}{Summary statistics of treatment effect variation}
\item{variable_importance}{Variable importance for heterogeneity}
\item{heterogeneity_test}{Test results for treatment effect heterogeneity}
}
}
\description{
Demonstrates how to use causal forests to estimate conditional average
treatment effects (CATE) and test for treatment effect heterogeneity.
}
\details{
This function demonstrates the core workflow for causal forest analysis:
\enumerate{
\item Fits a causal forest using honest sample splitting
\item Predicts individual treatment effects Ï„(x)
\item Tests for significant treatment effect heterogeneity
\item Calculates variable importance for effect modification
\item Provides interpretation of results
}

Causal forests use random forest methodology adapted for causal inference,
providing unbiased estimates of heterogeneous treatment effects while
maintaining valid statistical inference.

# Run with simulated data
results <- workshop_causal_forest()

# Check for heterogeneity
results$heterogeneity_stats

# View variable importance
results$variable_importance

# Use custom parameters
results <- workshop_causal_forest(
  data = my_data,
  num_trees = 2000,
