## Installation

### Prerequisites

- **R version**: 4.0.0 or higher
- **Operating System**: Windows, macOS, or Linux
- **Required system tools**: 
  - Git (for development)
  - C++ compiler (usually handled automatically by R)

### Method 1: Direct Installation (Recommended)

```r
# Install devtools if not already installed
if (!requireNamespace("devtools", quietly = TRUE)) {
  install.packages("devtools")
}

# Install causalworkshop from GitHub
devtools::install_github("go-bayes/causalworkshop")
```

### Method 2: Using the SPARCC Day 2 Workshop Helper

If you're taking the SPARCC Day 2 workshop, you can use the convenient installer script provided during the workshop, or install manually:

```r
# Manual installation for SPARCC Day 2
if (!requireNamespace("devtools", quietly = TRUE)) {
  install.packages("devtools")
}

# Install causalworkshop (includes all scripts)
devtools::install_github("go-bayes/causalworkshop")

# Install margot for advanced workflows
devtools::install_github("go-bayes/margot")
```

This will install `causalworkshop` along with all required dependencies for the complete workshop experience.

### Method 3: Development Installation

For contributors or advanced users who want the latest development version:

```r
# Install with vignettes and suggests packages
devtools::install_github("go-bayes/causalworkshop", 
                        dependencies = TRUE, 
                        build_vignettes = TRUE)
```

### Verifying Installation

After installation, verify everything works:

```r
# Load the package
library(causalworkshop)

# Check prerequisites
check_workshop_prerequisites()

# Run a quick test
workshop_results <- run_workshop(n = 100, verbose = FALSE)
```

### Troubleshooting

**Common Issues and Solutions:**

1. **Package compilation errors**: Install Rtools on Windows or Xcode command line tools on macOS
2. **Missing dependencies**: Run `install.packages(c("grf", "dplyr", "ggplot2"))` manually
3. **margot package issues**: Install latest version with `devtools::install_github("go-bayes/margot")`
4. **Permission errors**: On macOS/Linux, you may need to install packages to a user library

**Getting Help:**
- Create an issue: https://github.com/go-bayes/causalworkshop/issues
- Check existing issues for similar problems
- Include your R version and operating system in bug reports

## Quick Start

### Option 1: Get Workshop Scripts (Recommended for Learning)

```r
library(causalworkshop)

# Copy all workshop scripts to your working directory
get_workshop_scripts()

# See what scripts are available
list_workshop_scripts()

# Work through the scripts in order:
# 01-baseline-adjustment.R    - Foundation concepts
# 02-causal-forest-analysis.R - Core methodology  
# 03-rate-qini-curves.R      - Performance evaluation
# 04-policy-trees.R          - Decision rules
# 05-margot-workflow.R       - Professional analysis
# 06-interpretation.qmd       - Results reporting
```

### Option 2: Run the Complete Workshop Function

```r
library(causalworkshop)

# Check prerequisites
check_workshop_prerequisites()

# Run complete educational pipeline
workshop_results <- run_workshop()

# View key results
workshop_results$baseline_results$results_table
workshop_results$causal_forest_results$heterogeneity_stats

# Display educational plots
workshop_results$selection_bias_plot
workshop_results$heterogeneity_plot
workshop_results$targeting_plots$rate_plot
```

### Individual Workshop Modules

```r
# 1. Simulate realistic data
data <- simulate_religious_data(n = 2000)

# 2. Demonstrate selection bias
baseline_results <- workshop_baseline_adjustment(data)
plot_selection_bias(baseline_results$results_table)

# 3. Estimate heterogeneous treatment effects
cf_results <- workshop_causal_forest(data)
plot_heterogeneity_distribution(cf_results$predictions)

# 4. Evaluate targeting performance
targeting_plots <- plot_rate_qini_curves(cf_results$predictions)
targeting_plots$rate_plot
targeting_plots$qini_plot
```

## Workshop Content

### Module 1: Selection Bias and Baseline Adjustment
Learn why naive comparisons fail in observational studies and how baseline adjustment addresses selection bias.

```r
# Demonstrates selection bias
baseline_results <- workshop_baseline_adjustment()
baseline_results$bias_reduction  # Quantifies improvement
```

### Module 2: Causal Forests for Heterogeneous Effects
Discover how machine learning can estimate individual treatment effects while maintaining valid statistical inference.

```r
# Estimates conditional average treatment effects τ(x)
cf_results <- workshop_causal_forest()
cf_results$heterogeneity_stats   # Summary of effect variation
cf_results$variable_importance   # Drivers of heterogeneity
```

### Module 3: Targeting and Policy Analysis
Explore how treatment effect heterogeneity can inform policy targeting decisions.

```r
# Evaluates targeting performance
plots <- plot_rate_qini_curves(cf_results$predictions)
plots$efficiency_data  # Targeting efficiency metrics
```
